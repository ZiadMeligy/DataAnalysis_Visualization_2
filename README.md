# Medical Appointments Data Analysis



### This repository contains the code and data files for a data analysis project on a medical appointments dataset. The dataset consists of records of over 100,000 medical appointments in Brazil, including information on patient demographics, medical conditions, appointment scheduling, and attendance.

### The goal of this project is to explore the dataset and answer some key questions related to medical appointments in Brazil, such as:

- What factors influence a patient's decision to show up or not show up for their appointment?
- How do the characteristics of the patient (e.g., age, gender, health conditions) relate to their likelihood of attending their appointment?
- Are there any patterns or trends in the scheduling of appointments across different regions, healthcare providers, or time periods?
- Can we predict the likelihood of a patient showing up for their appointment based on their demographic and medical information?
To address these questions, we will perform various exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, including data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis. We will also use machine learning algorithms to build predictive models and evaluate their performance.
